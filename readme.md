# ft_irc

ft_irc is a project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum that focuses on building an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server and client. It emphasizes network programming, concurrent connections, and real-time communication between users over a network.

## Key Features:

- Server-Client Architecture: Implements a server that manages multiple client connections, enabling real-time messaging.
- Message Broadcasting: Allows messages to be sent to all users within the same channel.
- Channel Management: Supports creating, joining, and leaving channels for organized communication.
- Command Parsing: Handles IRC commands like JOIN, PART, and PRIVMSG for user interactions.
- Concurrent Connections: Manages multiple users simultaneously using socket programming and proper synchronization.

*By working on ft_irc, you gain practical experience in network programming, socket communication, and handling concurrent connections, providing a solid foundation for building real-time, networked applications.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and is intended as a learning exercise rather than a production-grade IRC server.
